# cc bermuda

Develop a Noir function that computes a Merkle tree root just like the Circom/Solidity reference implementation does.

Make sure that correctness of your Noir function can be verified easily by running it against one of the reference implementations in some reproducible manner.

If you are using the Solidity version for reference, on Base Sepolia there is a predeployed Poseidon hasher at `0x676E190EbA27d6Ef62427501e9C63D7A4b6cC702`.
